# Developmental-Analysis-of-EV-Charging-Stations-in-

This study delves into the electric vehicle (EV) transportation systems within the city of Toronto with a particular emphasis on addressing congestion at charging stations. The central objective is to comprehensively examine the intricacies of charging station congestion for electric buses and its repercussions on the sustainability of urban transportation. The approach involves generating visual models that highlight anomalies in the study's variables. Employing advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, data analytics, and multi-dimensional modelling, the project explores the influence of various factors on charging station wait times and the lifespan of EV batteries. The aim is to highlight external elements affecting the development and adaptability of EV infrastructure in Toronto, thereby impacting the existing transportation system. By analyzing factors such as charging station congestion and EV vehicle density, the research seeks to provide insights into enhancing charging availability, promoting EV awareness, and assessing strategies for improving charging infrastructure and locations. In collaboration with Solv4x's ongoing project with Metrolinx, this project contributes to the development of a strategic framework. The findings aim to assist Solv4x and other stakeholders in the industry by elucidating how specific isolated variables intersect to influence the efficiency and integration of EVs in Toronto. Visualizations such as heat change maps, weighted models, choropleth, and other available models will be utilized to analyze variables such as EV charging station density, distribution of EVs, traffic congestion, and environmental temperatures. Moreover, the study will acknowledge limitations such as missing data, which may impact the findings; despite these limitations, the study provides a foundation for understanding and addressing the current charging station congestion in Toronto.<br />

## Background Research<br />

Cities around the world are making shifts from traditional diesel-fueled vehicles to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), vehicles that run primarily on renewable sources like electricity or hydrogen. According to the World Resources Institute, several countries like Norway (80%), Iceland (41%), Sweden (32%), the Netherlands (24%) and China (22%) have the highest percentages of EV sales from all passenger vehicles sold in 2022 (Jaeger, 2023). Some countries in particular are not only supporting the transition of diesel to electric vehicles for light-duty vehicles like passenger cars but also are implementing initiatives to promote emission-free public transportation systems to further reduce the harmful emissions of the transport system. For example, Reykjavik, Iceland plans to introduce more hydrogen buses and triple public transport usage by 2030 according to Reykjavik’s City Municipal Plan. According to the Government of Canada, "the transportation sector accounts for 25% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions" and making the shift to zero-emission alternatives is a crucial step for significantly reducing harmful emissions (Infrastructure Canada). In this global context, Canada has actively joined the movement by proposing new regulations in December 2022, which mandate all new light-duty vehicles sold by 2035 must be ZEVs (Government of Canada, 2022). Light-duty refers to vehicles such as passenger cars, SUVs and small trucks (Government of Canada). According to the government, light-duty vehicles like these account for almost half of Canada's transportation emissions and setting this target for 2035 makes the future of Canada having net-zero emissions by 2050 possible (Government of Canada). Starting in 2026, companies are expected to transition to selling more electric vehicles by slowly increasing the percentage of ZEVs they sell, starting at 20% of all vehicles sold in 2026 (Government of Canada). Each year onwards, the percentage would “increase annually to at least 60 percent by 2030 and 100 percent for 2035” (Government of Canada). By 2035, all new vehicles sold would be ZEVs. However, gas and diesel vehicles can still be driven and bought as used vehicles after 2035 (Government of Canada). The government explains that when you consider the average vehicle has a life of 15 years, putting this target of “100% ZEV sales by 2035” means Canada can eliminate the “use of these polluting vehicles by 2050” (Government of Canada).<br />

Canada further emphasizes its dedication through initiatives like the $2.75 billion Zero Emission Transit Fund, which aims to support public transit and school bus operators nationwide in electrifying their fleets (Infrastructure Canada). These commitments aim to support the transition to cleaner transportation alternatives and align with international efforts to reduce carbon emissions. As the first step in creating a more sustainable transportation landscape, Metrolinx, the Government of Ontario-founded agency coordinating public transportation in the Greater Toronto Area, has initiated the transition of electrifying its GO bus fleet (Metrolinx, 2023). Recently, they just moved on to the next phase of their testing trials in May 2023. They are actively testing their electric vehicle (EV) technology on the road using two EV GO buses that are being used by real public riders on routes 19, 27, 92, and 96B (Metrolinx). To support this transition, Metrolinx has partnered with Solv4x, a technology start-up specializing in creating artificial intelligence-powered Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions for electric vehicle fleet and charging infrastructure management. As students working under the guidance of Solv4x's founder and CEO, Rekha Sharma, our project aims to supplement the ongoing work between Solv4x and Metrolinx as they work to create a software solution that will allow Metrolinx and possibly other similar transportation projects around the world to efficiently track and manage their electric vehicles and charging stations infrastructure models.<br />

## Current Issues with Electric Vehicles<br />
Although there is now a large movement of interest in EVs, there are still many issues barring the transition of society from choosing the fully electric model. Driving range and battery charging efficiency are lacking in comparison to its gasoline-powered counterparts. There are also big issues with the End of Life environmental impact. These lithium batteries are very hard to process once they are disposed of and require extensive processing to be converted into waste. Hence, the more upscale transitions to EVs will produce higher amounts of waste. Since one car can cycle through an indefinite amount of batteries, this raises the question of how to deal with and process the enormous quantities of batteries efficiently and safely. A study in Thailand finds that the reasons people are buying EVs are primarily because of performance efficiency and environmental concerns. The study findings say that companies should be worried more about battery efficiency, and all influencing variables, as a way to incentivize people into purchasing more EVs. The final and more predominant issue is the issue of big data. Many studies state that in recent years EVs have been a major focus of development. However, one issue is the numerous variables that can alter an EV’s battery life performance. Current models are inefficient as they lack the capability to incorporate all the variables that can affect EV battery life. For example, we were asked to specifically focus on traffic congestion and its effect on EV battery life, as more frequent and longer stops drain the battery faster, which in turn reduces the distance that an EV can drive until it needs recharging again. This is different from diesel vehicles as EVs use energy to move and constantly starting and stopping uses a lot of energy each time. As a result, new studies are being conducted to find more accurate ways to understand EV capabilities. As mentioned by Energy5, “a recent study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory” reveals that “electric cars can lose up to 63% of their range when driving in heavy traffic” (Energy5, 2023). This is why it is important to analyze how congestion on roads and more specifically, congestion in EV charging stations, can further drain EV batteries and which other factors further contribute and how they can be mitigated.<br />

## Sustainable Future with Electric Vehicles<br />
Electric vehicles have been in the limelight for their sustainable use and long-term benefits despite the current issues their industry is facing. To avoid relying on combustion engine vehicles which are contributing to emissions, high healthcare costs and regulatory market risks, EVs need to be highlighted more for their contribution to sustainability. For instance, the government of Canada offers a purchase incentive of up to $5,000 for electric vehicle purchases. In Québec, electric vehicles qualify for up to $8,000 in incentives. In British Columbia, they qualify for up to $5,000 in incentives'' (Plug 'N Drive).  This is because electric vehicles in the Canadian market promote a better quality of life for Canadian citizens, especially in metropolitan spots like the GTA. Similarly, Solv4x also primarily works in the electric vehicle market, which is why they are working with electric buses during their current partnership with Metrolinx. Firstly, with the use of electric vehicles, there could be a significant decrease in greenhouse emissions. According to the National Resources Defence Council, electrification reduces ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). These reductions can contribute to “a PEV today [having] 54 percent lower lifetime carbon pollution today. In 2050, the reduction could be larger, as much as 59 to 71 percent compared to a more efficient combustion vehicle (CV) that achieves 48 miles per gallon in real-world driving, depending on the electricity grid carbon intensity” (NDRC). This means that, traditionally, the use of CVs generates an excess amount of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide which generally result in a lot of greenhouse emissions leading to poor air quality. As the National Resources Defence Council mentioned, with the idea of electrification, this issue can be tackled. Moreover, in comparison to CVs, EVs tend to reduce noise pollution as well since “they don’t have an internal combustion engine and therefore do not require as much power upon acceleration, EVs are not nearly as noisy as a gas-powered vehicle” (Nextridens). Reducing air and noise pollution will promote a better lifestyle for GTA residents. Lastly, it is financially easier to maintain electric vehicles than it is with combustion engine vehicles. Along with being cheaper “Electric buses and van units are also much easier to monitor. Onboard tech and software allow the e-bus manufacturer to track your system remotely so they can instantly flag a sudden loss in battery pack performance” (Cresline Buses). With a cheaper and environmentally friendly option for public transit, the citizens will benefit in the long run. Overall, electric vehicles in the GTA can contribute to local development which can ripple down to an overall global impact to promote a long ecological footprint.<br />

## Limitations<br />
We focused exclusively on Toronto for this project due to a lack of comprehensive data covering electric vehicles (EVs) and speed indices across the entire Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Obtaining such datasets for the GTA posed challenges, due to factors such as incomplete/missing records, the absence of relevant information and the privatization of certain data. Our decision to primarily use data for light-duty EVs (i.e. passenger cars) was because of a similar constraint since there was limited data available for EV buses due to issues such as the non-existence of such public transportation systems and/or privatization of such data. <br />
